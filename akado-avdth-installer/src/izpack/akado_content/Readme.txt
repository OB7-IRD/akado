The AKADO tool automatically performs a series of tests on the data 
and produces summary tables that provide more or less detailed balance 
anomalies. The new version of AKADO, called "AKaDo 2", is a fusion of 
different software developed by the Tropical Tuna Observatory team, 
i.e. "BaBys", "AKADO 4.x" and many SQL queries. The purpose of this 
new version is to prepare the transition with the electronic logbook 
based on the ERS.

AKaDo runs with compatible databases with the latest evolution of 
AVDTH model data (version 3.5). All predicates evaluated since the 
3.3 version of the AKADO are included in this version. 
We also introduced many new controls.  Like the previous version, 
the importation in T3+ shall not include major errors; it is a guarantee 
that engages the AVDTH technology.

This version of AKaDo produces a spreadsheet document easy to read 
on screen. The spreadsheet must improve the treatment results with 
more effective than a web browser interface.
